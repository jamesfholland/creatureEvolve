###### Hill vs Genetic  
After analysis, hill climbing was superior to our genetic algorithm. There are several reasons for this. They are documented below.
1. We didn't put as much effort into the genetic algorithm. Our focus was split between hill climbing and creature validation until the last weeks of the project.  
2. We failed to implementing a culling aspect to the algorithm. We planned to remove weak creatures, but didn't implement them into our algorithm in time.  
3. We accidentally left a temporary switching time in the algorithm. We weren't sure when was best to switch back to hill climbing, so we put a temporary trigger to always switch after 15 minutes. We then forgot to change this to a reasonable switching heuristic.
