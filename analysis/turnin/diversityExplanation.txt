###### General Overview  
With each generation diversity would only be lost during the genetic algorithm. Hill climbing would maintain a full genepool of unique creatures. Similiarities between creatures are coincidental. During the genetic algorithm, merging creatures will result in a reduction of diversity in the gene pool. To get around this, whenever two parents are replaced, a new randomized creature is added to the pool.

###### Analysis
To analyze if our diversification was actually occuring, I developed an algorithm that built family trees for each creature in the gene pool. Diversity was planned to be calculated by tracing creature's pedigrees and calculating the percentage of each seed creature a descendant was. This would be summed into the diversity value.

###### HashCode bug
During the analysis, it became clear that something wasn't working. The diversity was increasing at a linear rate compared to the number of generations. Detailed analysis of the logs showed that our creature hashing method was not computing a unique hash. Multiple creatures were getting the same hash and corrupting our diversity algorithm.

###### Future Fix
To fix this, a new method of uniquely identifying creatures is required. Either find the bug in the hashcode methods or writing a new method for identifying the creature.
